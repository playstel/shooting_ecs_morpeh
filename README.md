# ECS Morpeh Test in Unity

This project briefly shows how the [Morpeh ECS](https://github.com/scellecs/morpeh) works. 

First-person view, the hero is moving forward, has a movement speed, and can deviate left or right if the player holds the mouse button. 

When you press the SPACE, a shooting event is triggered through [Morpeh.Events](https://github.com/codewriter-packages/Morpeh.Events). 

Shooting is accompanied by VFX, SFX, Animation.

There are a few objects: rifle and bullets. Each object has Components, Providers, and Systems.

In addition, a bullet has Initializer and EventBulletTrigger (IEventData).
